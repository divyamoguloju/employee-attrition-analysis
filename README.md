# Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes employee data to understand key drivers of attrition and predict which employees are likely to leave.

## Objective
- Identify factors contributing to employee attrition
- Build a prediction model to classify attrition risk

## Dataset
IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset from Kaggle

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature encoding
- Model building using Random Forest
- Model evaluation

## Outcome
The model identifies employees at high risk of attrition and highlights key influencing factors such as overtime, job role, and income.
